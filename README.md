## Deployment on Remix IDE

To deploy the contract using Remix IDE:

1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. Create a new file and paste the smart contract code (`ERC-721contract.sol`).
3. Compile the contract:
   - Navigate to the "Solidity Compiler" tab.
   - Select the appropriate compiler version (matching the `pragma solidity` version in your contract).
   - Click on "Compile".
4. Deploy the contract:
   - Go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.
   - Select the environment as **Injected Provider - MetaMask**.
   - Connect your MetaMask wallet to the Sepolia network.
   - Deploy the contract by selecting it and clicking "Deploy".
5. Look if your transaction has been confirmed on [Sepolia Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/)

## Verifying the Contract on Sepolia Explorer

To verify the contract on the Sepolia Explorer:

1. In Remix IDE; 
   -  Right-click on the contract file in the File Explorer.
   -  Select Flatten to combine all imported files into a single file.
   -  Copy the flattened script generated by Remix.
2. Go to [Sepolia Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/).
3. Paste the deployed contract address in the search bar.
4. Navigate to the **Contract** tab and click "Verify and Publish".
5. Follow these steps:
   - Select the Solidity version used during deployment.
   - Paste the flattened contract code into the editor.
   - Provide the compiler settings (e.g., optimization enabled or disabled).
   - Submit the verification request.
6. Once verified, the contract will be accessible.

## Hosting Metadata on IPFS via Pinata

To store your NFT assets (image and metadata) on IPFS:

1. **Create an account on [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/).**
2. **Upload an image**:
   - Navigate to the "IPFS Files" section.
   - Upload your desired .png image.
   - Copy the CID of the uploaded image.
3. **Create a metadata JSON file**:
   - Create a file named `metadata.json` with the following structure:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "My Business Card NFT",
       "description": "A digital representation of my business card with contact details.",
       "image": "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<CID_of_image>",
       "attributes": [
            {
            "name": "Mariusgal",
            "description": "This is my business card as an NFT."
          }
       ]
     }
     
     ```
   - Replace `<CID_of_image>` with the CID copied earlier.
4. **Upload the metadata .JSON** to Pinata and copy its CID.

## The `safeMint` Function

To mint a new NFT using the `safeMint` function:

1. Open Remix IDE and navigate to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.
2. Under "Deployed Contracts", expand the deployed contract instance.
3. Call the `safeMint` function:
   - Input the **recipient's address** and the **metadata URI** (e.g., `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<CID_of_metadata>`).
   - Click "Transact" and confirm the transaction in MetaMask.
4. Once the transaction is confirmed:
   - The new NFT will be minted and assigned to the specified address.
   - You can now verify on platforms like [OpenSea Testnets](https://testnets.opensea.io/).

## Conclusion

Following these steps, you will have successfully deployed an ERC-721 contract on Sepolia, verified the contract, stored metadata on IPFS, and used the `safeMint` function to mint NFTs.
